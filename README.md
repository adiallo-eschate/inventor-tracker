# Dead Inventory Tracker (Next.js + Supabase)

## Purpose
I built this project to keep track of dead stock in inventory without using spreadsheets or messy notes. The goal was to have a dead-simple web app where I can add items that have not sold for a while, update counts, and know what’s selling and what's not.

## What Was Done
- Set up a Next.js app with server components and API routes  
- Hooked it up to Supabase for auth + a Postgres database  
- Created tables for items, categories, and stock levels  
- Built CRUD pages for adding, editing, and deleting inventory  
  

## What I Learned
- How to setup Supabase database + auth setup  
- How to use Next.js server actions / API routes with a real backend  
- Handling real-time data and syncing UI state  
- Structuring a small app’s database
- Used Row Level Security in Supabase database to ensure database security
